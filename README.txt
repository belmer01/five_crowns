# Five Crowns Scorekeeper
This is an app to keep score for the card game Five Crowns.

My family likes to play it and so does just my wife and I.
The app will have two sections: single play and ongoing competition.
Single play will just keep score for that one game.  Ongoing competition
will allow you to create a group that plays together often and will
keep a tally of how many times each person has won.  The app will 
also display the best score ever recorded and the worst score 
ever recorded.

The original language for the app is Python.  However, it will need
to be translated into Swift and Java in order to create an 
app on phones.
